# Overview

COGS 108 - Data Science in Practice - is a class offered by the Cognitive Science Department of UC San Diego, taught by Professors Bradley Voytek, Shannon Ellis, and Jason Fleischer. Here is an overview and map of the COGS 108 Organization, which hosts materials and assignments for the class.

## Syllabus 

The most recent iteration of this class is Winter 2025 quarter, the **syllabus** for which is available [here](https://github.com/COGS108/Overview/blob/wi25/COGS108-Syllabus.md).

## Discussion Section

* [Discussion Labs](https://datahub.ucsd.edu) are released, completed, and submitted on datahub
* [Tutorial Notebooks](https://github.com/COGS108/Tutorials) that run along with the topics of the class and can help as you complete assignments and discussion section tasks.

## Assignments

## Readings

A suggested [reading list](https://github.com/COGS108/Readings) (recommended, but not required).

## A reminder about time: 

Assignments are intermingled with your project proposal, checkpoints and final project (due finals week). This is an assignment-heavy course load to get you as much practice as possible. This will require good time management and planning on your part. Start planning ahead now to avoid late submissions and issues later in the quarter.
