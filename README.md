## A reminder about time: 

These assignments are intermingled with your project proposal, checkpoints and final project (due finals week). This is an assignment-heavy course load to get you as much practice as possible. This will require good time management and planning on your part. Start planning ahead now to avoid late submissions and issues later in the quarter.
